# """`Keepassxc-cli` wrapper to ease the of CLI for database unlocked with key file.
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#
#   keepass.sh command [options]
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
#   THIS WRAPPER REQUIRES ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE `KEEPASS_DB` AND
#   `KEEPASS_KEYFILE` TO BE SET. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE IT WITH
#   [DIRENV](https://direnv.net).
#
#   The wrapper allow to use most `keepassxc-cli` command without requiring to
#   provide the `--no-password`, `--key-file <path>` or the keepass database
#   path as these information are stored with environment variables:
#
#   | Variables         | Description                                                    |
#   | :---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
#   | `KEEPASS_DB`      | Path to a keepass database, that must be unlocked by a keyfile |
#   | `KEEPASS_KEYFILE` | Path to a keyfile unlocking the keepass database               |
#
#
#   `keepassxc-cli` is the command line interface for the KeePassXC password
#   manager. It provides the abil‐ ity to query and modify the entries of a
#   KeePass database, directly from the command line.
